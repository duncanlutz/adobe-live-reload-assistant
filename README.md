# Adobe Live Reload Assistant
This is the repository for the Google Chrome extension of the same name.

### Installation
The extension is currently awaiting Chrome Store approval, so you must install it as an unpacked Chrome extension.

If you haven't yet, install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DuncanLutz.alr).

Then you'll need to clone this repo using:

```git clone https://github.com/duncanlutz/adobe_live_reload_assistant.git```.

After this, you'll need to actually install the extension. You can do so by following the instructions [here.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked)

### Usage
After installing both the VS Code and Chrome extensions, navigate to the folder of the extension you'd like to debug.

Then run the "Run Adobe Live Reload" command in the VS Code command palette, or use the shortcut specified in the README [here](https://github.com/duncanlutz/Adobe-Live-Reload).

Adobe Live Reload should open your current extension in Google Chrome, and you're ready to debug!
